## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The only JavaScript you'll need for this challenge is to initiate the share options when someone clicks the share icon.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned some layout issues to look out for when checking the overall design of a card, such as things that should and should not overflow. I also learned how to fetch svg and add it into the DOM as svg so the as an svg element, the shapes could be editted, rather than a flat image.

### Continued development

I want to explore more on fetch and then, since I have learned this in the past but only ever used async syntax. I would also want to learn how to style using Javascript instead of CSS especially with positioning, since I ran into problems that could have been solved by that.
